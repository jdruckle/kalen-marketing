                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
                between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
                no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
                right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
                or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
                authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
                capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

              <br/>
              <p>
                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
                provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to
                enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual
                property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
                allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
                (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
                illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
                Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
                or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
                Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
