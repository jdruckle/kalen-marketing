                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
                device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
                in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
                as to provide reporting information.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Kalen Marketing Solutions )
                are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
                website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable
                third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
                website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The
                parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both
                when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
                other websites.

                Why do we use cookies?

              <br/>
              <p>
                We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
                required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we
                refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
                cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
                enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve
                cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
                This is described in more detail below.

              <p>
                The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
                Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
                that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online

              <br/>
              <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
                exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
                Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
                categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
                rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
                our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website
                though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
                restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept
                or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through
                your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit
                your browser's help menu for more information.

              <p>
                Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
                We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
                (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
                graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize
                when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them.
                This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from
                one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
                cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online
                advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
                performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In
                many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
                properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

            placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
