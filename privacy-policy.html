                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary

                period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
                legal requirements).
              </p>
              <p>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
                information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
                possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
                backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
                isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

                measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
                process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
                internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect
                your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from
                our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services
                within a secure environment.

                will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete
                such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have
                collected from children under age 18, please contact us at

            </p>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
              include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to
              signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
              activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
              recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
              not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
              automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
              standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
              notice.
